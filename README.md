# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## 🙋‍♂️About Me
Hello, I'm currently working as a Junior Localisation Engineer at Rubric, where I focus on developing and refining localisation pipelines using Python. My daily work involves the utilisation of regular expressions, XML, and JSON. I collaborate with various teams to enhance translation processes and address issues as they arise.

I hold strong competencies in tools like Git, JSONPath, XPath, and version control systems. Through agile project management, I constantly navigate challenges and ensure the reliability of our systems.
