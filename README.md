# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èAbout Me

Hello, I'm currently working as a Junior Localization Engineer at Rubric, where I focus on developing and refining localization pipelines using Python. My daily work involves automating localization processes to efficiently handle various formats of client files and make them translatable. I utilize Python along with regular expressions, XML, and JSON to build and maintain tools that streamline the translation and localization process.

I collaborate closely with multiple teams to enhance translation processes and troubleshoot issues as they arise. My toolkit includes Git, JSONPath, XPath, and version control systems, which support my work in agile project environments. This allows me to effectively navigate challenges and ensure the reliability and scalability of our systems.
